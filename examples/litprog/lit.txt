# A simple Literate Programming tool

## Introduction
  A *literate programming* tools enable programmers to layout a source file according
the order that is more natural for explaining what that code does.

  The key principle is that concepts that are logically related should be described close
to each other. This is often not the case as programmers are forced to write code in 
the order that is most convenient for the compiler.

  A classical example is the use of headers files in C. Variables and types are defined
in the header file, while the operation on them are defined in a C source file.  This
implies that those who want to understand how things work, have to jump from a file to
the other.

## Requirements

    - Use MarkDown as typesetting language
    - Ability to generate multiple files from a single lit file
    - Ability to generate an identifiers index across multiple project files
    - Generates HTML output for single files and for "projects" (a set of files)
    - Generates PDF input (??)

## Block types

  The key concept is the _block_
  
   - `:(> "filename" [filetype]`   
   - `:(= block title`
   - `:(^ block title`
   - `:(v block title`
   - `:(< "filename" ):`

# Generated files

  Since the task is rather simple, all the files will be described in this document.
  
## The C file

:(> "lit.c" C

   #include "lit.h"
   
   int main(int argc, char *argc[])
   {
     //: Get command line options   
     //: Parse input files          
     //: Generate output files      
     //: Update index of identifiers
   }
   
):

## The header file 

:(> "lit.h" C

    #include "utl.h"
 
    //: Defines
    //: Types     
    //: Variables 
    //: Prototypes

):

## The Makefile

:(out makefile mk

_EXE=.exe
ifeq "$(COMSPEC)" ""
_EXE=
endif

lit$(_EXE): lit.o
  $(CC) -o lit$(_EXE) lit.o
  
):

# Parsing input files

:(v Parse input files
    char *f;
    for (char *fname = files[0]; fname; fname++) {
      f = fopen(fname,"r");
      if (f) {
        :( Find blocks and targets ):
        fseek(f,SEEK_SET,0); 
        :( Replace blocks ):
        fclose(f):
      }
      else logprintf("ERR ");
    }   
):
